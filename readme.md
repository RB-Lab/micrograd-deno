# MicroGrad in Deno land :sauropod:

A [Deno][1] re-implementation of [micrograd][2] educational backpropagation library by Andrej
Karpathy (@karpathy). I wrote it after watching his [intro into neural nets lecture][3]. Both of
which (watch the video and re-implementing `micrograd` with your favorite language) I can highly
recommend.
